This is a project about the C pre processor.
The C preprocessor is a macro processor that is used automatically by the C compiler to transform the program before actual compilation. It is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros.

I have since learnt that one can use macros as functions, but as abbreviations of .....longer stuff.

Keep macros in caps CAPS

Twende Kazi!
