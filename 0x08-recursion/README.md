An interesting project with tasks on recursive functions.
From my understanding, recursive functions call themselves.
They are iterations that can  occur using oops just like the for , whiletc loops we were using before

The diff is that recursive functions need a base case in order for them to avoid an infinite loop
or even a segmentation fault.

So for recurssion, n! = n * (n - 1)!

Okay...let's do some coding :-)
