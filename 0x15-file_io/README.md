There is a difference between system calls and functions.
 WHile all system calls are functions, not all functions are system calls. 
So the use of write(), open(), ....are what wer look into.
We combine this with our knowledge on but manipulation in that 0-wronly << 1 is equal to 2 etc etc

In task 0, Write a function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.
Task 1: I create a function that creates a function. For this I intend to use write
In task 2 I am supposed to Write a function that appends text at the end of a file. For this, I think I will use -append flag
Finally I have been tasked to Write a program that copies the content of a file to another file. I think we did a similar task before...
hmm...Oh, I think that was copying a string through _strcmp. I might try to utilise this to create the function and see if it works.

Okay, kama kawaida, Twende Kazi!
