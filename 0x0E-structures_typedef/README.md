A struct is a user defined structure...of data in which I can store multiple data types and reference a contiguous block of physical memory.
The basic syntax is 
	struct tag_name 
{
   type member1;
   type member2;

   /* declare as many members as desired, but the entire structure size must be known to the compiler. */
};

typdef thenhelps me define a new type
