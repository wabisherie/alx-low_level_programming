In this project we work with 2D/multidimensional arrays.

It is exciting getting to understand how data is stored in tables using pointer to pointer as well as 2D and 3D arrays!

In the first project we work on a protiotype that functions like memset().
This  fils the memory pointed to by a pointer with n bytes.
