This is a project in which I dive deeper into the topic on arrays and pointers.
From my understanding, an array is a data structure that allows us to store info...data...in a way that uses less memory.
I understand that the best way to declare an array is something like this 
		int name_of_array[] = {10, 45, 66, 52, 726, 88}

This way I wont have to manually add each of the ints stored inside the array as I would if I used this declaration;
		int name_of_array[5];
Also, there us the rea fear od the system crashing cause of forgetting to leave space for the null byte which I think my code above forgot to include!!!!

Anyway,

Pointers *p point the address in which the data has been stored.

Let me not make this too long.

It's project time!
